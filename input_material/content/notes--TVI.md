# Notes on `TVI`s

`TVI`s are deliberately defined in quite abstract terms. A `TVI` can be thought of as simply a mechanism for identifying a number of `TDS`s that are conveying the same "message".

Given relatively few constraints are applied to `TVI`s, there is the prospect for a number of 'grey areas' in what can be viewed to represent the same `TVI`. This is intended to allow the user to decide the most appropriate degree of 'similarity' between `TDS`s which are permitted to be identified as being approximations of the same `TVI`. In a practical and interoperable implementation it is likely that some additional constraints will need to be applied to what a `TVI` can be represented by in order for it to be useful.
