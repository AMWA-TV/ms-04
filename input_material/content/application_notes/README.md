# Application Notes

This directory contains a set of worked examples showing how the core model may be applied to a range of production scenarios.

In each case, aspects of the model may be applied in subtly different ways. This is intended to show the freedom which the core model provides in mapping to a range of existing technologies. As this work progresses and the 'NMOS model' is defined, it is intended that these options would be reduced to make it clear to manufacturers how to make their equipment interoperable.

The current set of application notes are listed below:
