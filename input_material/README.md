# AMWA Timing & Identity &ndash; BBC R&D input documents for discussion

This repository contains draft discussion documents from BBC R&D relating to the topic of "Timing & Identity".

## User Stories

This "Timing & Identity" work aims to address requirements stated as [User Stories](content/user-stories.md).

Ultimately the models developed should cover all the requirements raised by the User Stories and the models should be validated against them.

## Core Model

A model has been developed consisting of a small number of entities. The intention is that these form a "core" upon which all other modelling aspects can be built in order to ultimately meet all the requirements stated by the User Stories.

* The model: [overview](content/overview.md) and [full details](content/definitions.md)
* [Motivation](content/motivation.md) for designing the model
* [Explanation of the principles / approach](content/explanation-and-principles.md) behind the model

## Additional Constructs

As we progress through the modelling activity, some additional entities will be required to allow us to describe entities related to the core model. These are noted below:

* [Similarity Clusters](content/definitions--Similarity-Cluster.md)
* [Content Relationships](content/understanding--Relationships.pptx)
