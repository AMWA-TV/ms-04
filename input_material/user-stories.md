# Timing & Identity User Stories

AS A ... I NEED TO ... SO THAT ...

## From AMWA Project Proposal

1. AS A content producer I NEED TO easily identify elements of video, audio and data that come from a range of different sources with global scope SO THAT I can combine the correct elements to create content of value.**

    *Category: Identity*

2. AS A content producer I NEED TO easily identify particular times within video and audio elements SO THAT my production processes run efficiently.

    *Category: Identity*

3. AS A content producer I NEED TO combine related elements with appropriate synchronization through a range of operations and technical equipment SO THAT I can maintain high production quality without having to expend operator effort on manual selection and synchronization.

    *Category: Synchronisation*

4. AS A content producer I NEED TO work with live and non-live elements of video, audio and data in a consistent and correctly synchronized way SO THAT I can optimize my operations without the overhead of supporting different ways of working.

    *Category: Common approach to live/non-live*

5. AS A broadcaster I NEED TO automatically combine various combinations of video, audio and data with appropriate synchronization to support a range of different audience needs (platform, language, accessibility, etc.) SO THAT I maximize the value of my content.

    *Category: Handling related content*

6. AS A broadcaster I NEED TO be confident that a programme or other product that has been created from multiple video, audio and data elements will be played out or otherwise distributed with those correct elements in the correct synchronization SO THAT my reputation is not compromised.

    *Category: Synchronisation*

7. AS A content producer I NEED TO be sure my content can be rendered correctly in different forms (picture size, qualities, aspect ratio, HDR/SDR, conventional/3D/VR, etc.) with correct synchronisation between the video, audio and data elements SO THAT the quality of my output is not compromised on some platforms.

    *Category: Handling related content*

8. AS A facility owner / broadcaster I NEED a model that allows both legacy and future equipment to be used consistently through a workflow SO THAT my investment in currently available solutions can be protected.

    *Category: Legacy support*

9. AS AN implementer / integrator of packetised technologies such as ST 2022 and ST 2110 I NEED a model that can represent – within an end-to-end context – any content that has been subject to near-term synchronisation mechanisms  SO THAT my investment is protected.

    *Category: Synchronisation*

10. AS A manufacturer OR software developer I NEED a clear model for my customers’ future plans for handling content in different types of networked media environment SO THAT I can plan my product development.

  *Category: Describe workflows*

11. AS A manufacturer OR software developer I NEED to understand how technical (meta)data about the content is handled SO THAT I can plan my product development.

    *Category: Describe workflows*

12. AS AN implementer / integrator of web-based technologies I NEED a model that can identify and synchronise content within an end-to-end context using best practice in my domain SO THAT I can be sure my investment in techniques and technologies in implementing the model is worthwhile.

    *Categories: Identity and Synchronisation*

## Additional User Stories

13. AS A content producer I NEED TO refer to particular media units (frames, samples etc.) SO THAT I can create programmes from composition data such as edit decision lists.

    *Category: Identity*

14. AS A content producer I NEED TO time-align media elements (audio, video etc.) that have been captured or delivered independently SO THAT I can create programmes with correct synchronisation between the media elements.

    *Category: Synchronisation*

15. AS A content producer I NEED TO be able to discover live feeds and stored content in a consistent way, ideally without configuration or manual cataloguing SO THAT I can process and combine them to add editorial value with minimal overhead

    *Category: Identity*

16. AS A content producer I NEED TO be able to identify streams of content at the point of use SO THAT I can ensure that I am using the right content in a particular context.

    *Category: Identity*

17. AS A content producer I NEED TO be able to identify streams of content at the point of use SO THAT I can track ancestry as elements are processed and combined

    *Category: Identity*

18. AS A content producer I NEED TO identify live or stored video, audio and data elements independent of their format SO THAT I know that different representations of the same content are editorially equivalent

    *Category: Handle related content*

19. AS A content producer I NEED TO differentiate between representations of the same content SO THAT I can ensure that the appropriate format is selected for the operations I want to perform

    *Category: Handle related content*

20. AS A content producer I NEED a common foundation for referencing live and stored media elements in time SO THAT I can translate and track timing relationships between elements of different types of media and data at different points in the production chain with minimal overhead

    *Category: Common approach to live/non-live*

21. AS A manufacturer/software developer I NEED a universal way to discover and index content SO THAT I can build tools that work with any content, regardless of where, or in what form, it exists

    **Category: Identity*

22. AS A content producer I NEED TO describe the relationship of my video, audio and data elements to a common timing reference SO THAT I can deduce the synchronisation relationship between the elements and with other events occurring in the same frame of reference.

    *Category: Synchronisation*

23. AS A content producer I NEED TO use audio/video from non-synchronous devices such as mobile phones SO THAT I can increase the value of my content.

    *Category: Handle non-synchronous content*

24. AS A content producer I NEED TO associate metadata with content.

    *Category: Identity*

25. AS a content producer I NEED TO use content at a different rate from the rate it was captured SO THAT I can make programmes with slow-motion or other time-based effects.

    *Category: A combination of identity and synchronisation*

26. AS A content producer I NEED TO make composition decisions against a locally available rendition and have those decisions enacted on the corresponding remotely available content SO THAT I can save on the cost of sending production staff to remote events.

27. AS A content producer I NEED TO keep a record of the production processes used to create a piece of finished content SO THAT I can easily reproduce it in a different format to get more value from it.

28. AS A content producer I NEED TO keep a record of the original material used to create a piece of finished content SO THAT I can obtain the necessary rights to use it.

## Summary

The following seem to be some key elements:

* Identify media elements so you can refer to them, verify them, and track their processing
* Synchronise media elements in a composition 
* Handle live and non-live in a consistent way
* Define relationships between content (e.g. different renditions or processing ancestry)
* Make it easy to select and synchronise different components or renditions of the same content
* Support legacy equipment
* Provide a model which can be used to describe workflows
* Support non-synchronised content
