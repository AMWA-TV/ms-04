# Motivation

The focus is on the modelling of "timed data" because signals with a time dimension are clearly a fundamental part of A/V broadcast content production. Modelling of such data using generic "top-level" entities allows such data to be considered independently of any transport / packaging mechanisms and independent of (as well as potentially a constituent of) compositions and other content groupings. Furthermore, the models can apply to non-A/V data. Many existing models for (A/V) "timed data" only model the data within a specific scenario (for example: a particular A/V file format) &ndash; such models are not well-aligned with "object based" content ambitions.
